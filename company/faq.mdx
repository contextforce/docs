As AI space is changing rapidly, there will not be one model to fit all. 
To give our users the best experience, LEXI runs its own lab and determine which model is good for what kinds of tasks. 
For example, LEXI will handle your image creation over top tier image models while it will handle your summarization request over another LLM models that are good at this.
Because of this, we can save money so we can offer top quality model at low cost in return. 
Plus you don't need to sign up different services and deal with different SaaS company payments because you normally don't use them effectively.

Our goal is to bring AI to everyone's life and if you are not happy with our service, we will refund you!

  <Accordion title="How LEXI been trained to improve its service?">
Our vision is to democratize AI, empowering everyone to have their own personal AI assistant that is both private and intelligent. LEXI is designed to live on your device, acting on your behalf while ensuring your data remains under your control. <br/>

To achieve this, LEXI builds a local knowledge base on your machine, allowing it to reference past interactions and provide highly personalized responses. When you make a request, LEXI intelligently queries this local knowledge to craft a tailored prompt before reaching out to an LLM provider.  <br/>

For users who prioritize complete data privacy, LEXI supports local LLMs, enabling you to run AI models entirely on your own machine—without sending any data to external providers. <br/>

As we work towards fully decentralizing LEXI, it currently leverages both our in-house models and cutting-edge frontier LLMs to provide accurate and efficient responses. Our ongoing improvements focus on enhancing LEXI’s ability to learn from your preferences while giving you complete control over how and where your data is processed. <br/>
