## A Journey to Empowerment

At ContextForce, our story began with a question: *How can we make AI more than just a tool?*

We envisioned AI as a partner in creativity and productivity, seamlessly integrating into daily life. This vision drove us to create LEXI, our AI-powered Chrome extension - but its just the beginning.

<Note>
  LEXI is the first step in our mission to bring AI closer to you, with features designed to enhance your daily workflow without disruption.

## Building an AI Ecosystem

We're creating something bigger than just another AI assistant. Our goal is to develop an intelligent ecosystem that:

- Evolves with your usage patterns
- Adapts to your specific needs
- Enhances productivity naturally
- Preserves your privacy

<Steps>

    AI on your mobile devices, home assistants, and edge computing
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Challenging the Status Quo

<Info>
The modern web is controlled by a few large institutions that collect, train, and monetize AI models using your data. We're here to change that.

### Our Alternative Vision

Instead of big tech's walled gardens, we believe in:

- **Personal AI**: Your assistant learns your preferences safely and privately
- **Decentralized Control**: AI that sits on your edge devices
- **User Empowerment**: You control how intelligence is created and used
- **Privacy First**: No data harvesting or centralized control

<Tip>
We're building a future where AI serves individuals, not corporations. Your data stays yours, while the power of AI remains at your fingertips.
</Tip>

By putting AI directly in users' hands, we're working toward a future where intelligence augments human capability without compromising privacy or autonomy. This isn't just about building tools - it's about **democratizing AI for everyone**.
