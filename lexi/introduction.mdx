At Contextforce, we believe AI should be seamless, intuitive, and accessible—not something you have to struggle to integrate into your workflow. That’s why we built a powerful Chrome extension that brings AI to your fingertips, whether you’re browsing the web, managing knowledge, or optimizing your AI prompts.

Our mission is simple: Bridge the gap between AI and everyday users by embedding AI where it matters most—inside the tools you already use. No switching tabs, no manual copy-pasting—just smart, context-aware AI that enhances your productivity effortlessly.

### 🚀 We’re redefining how people interact with AI by providing:
* ✔️ **Web AI Assistant** – AI-powered buttons embedded directly into websites like YouTube, X.com, Gmail, Google, and Stack Overflow.
* ✔️ **Personal Knowledge Base** – A private, on-device knowledge repository where you can store, tag, and query your saved content.
* ✔️ **Smart Prompt Management** – Organize, retrieve, and automate AI prompts for maximum efficiency in your workflows.
* ✔️ **Pluggable AI Agents & Tools** – Customize LEXI with specialized AI apps for tasks like image enhancement, research, writing, and coding assistance—just like an AI-powered browser extension.

The future of AI isn’t just about better models—it’s about smarter integration. We’re here to make AI work for you, where you need it, when you need it.

Join us and experience a new way to interact with AI.
