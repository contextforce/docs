As AI space is changing rapidly, there will not be one model to fit all. 
To give our users the best experience, LEXI runs its own lab and determine which model is good for what kinds of tasks. 
For example, LEXI will handle your image creation over top tier image models while it will handle your summarization request over another LLM models that are good at this.
