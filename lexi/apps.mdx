title: Apps
description: "Think about the first time you used an app storeâ€”it changed everything. You didnâ€™t just get a single tool; you gained access to an entire ecosystem of apps, each tailored to specific needs. Instead of relying on one program to do everything, you could install exactly what worked best for you, expanding your deviceâ€™s capabilities on demand.

Thatâ€™s exactly what LEXI is doing for AI. Instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all AI model to handle every task, LEXI gives you the power to choose the AI tools and agents that fit your workflowâ€”just like installing apps. Whether youâ€™re capturing knowledge, automating tasks, analyzing data, or enhancing content, LEXI adapts to how you work, bringing AI intelligence exactly where you need it."
