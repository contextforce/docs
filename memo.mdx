      - Toggle the `Advanced` view to display the chunks that are being loaded into the memo database
    </Card>
    <Card title="How It Works">
      LEXI automatically processes content into searchable "chunks" - smaller pieces of information that make retrieval fast and accurate. 
      In Advanced mode, you can view these chunks to understand how your content is being organized.
